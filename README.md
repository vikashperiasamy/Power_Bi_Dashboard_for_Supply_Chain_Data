# Project Description
In this project, exploratory data analysis is performed on supply chain data using Power BI software, with the aid of a created dashboard for easier data visualisation and analysis. There are a few key focuses for this project:
* To investigate *key factors responsible for data observations pertaining to three categories: Sales, Delivery and Customer*
* To identify *opportunities to improve On-time Delivery, a key performance indicator related to the supply chain industry*

The project involves the following steps:
* **Data Sourcing and Extraction**: A suitably large, free-to-use dataset containing multiple factors is located and downloaded
* **Data Cleaning and Modelling**: The dataset is cleaned using Power Query software and uploaded into Power BI, where further measures and calcuations are created for analysis
* **Data Visualisation**: The cleaned and trasnformed dataset is loaded into various data visualisations (graphs, charts etc.), culminating in the creation of an interactive dashboard
* **Exploratory Data Analysis**: The dashboard is interpreted to view data interactions between various categories, so as to draw valuable insights 
# Dataset Details
The dataset used in this project is from Kaggle and belongs to a fictious company named "DataCo Global". The dataset contains details pertaining to supply chain data, including customer demographics, product categories, order, shipment, and price details, with data covering a duration of four years (2015 to 2018). Additional information as well as the raw dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shashwatwork/dataco-smart-supply-chain-for-big-data-analysis).
# Insights
Through exploratory data analysis, the following insights have been gathered:
*Note: Due to incomplete data resulting in skewing of results, only data up til 2017Q3 has been used in exploratory data analysis*

1. **Sales**
"Latin America" (~30.0%) and "Europe" (~27.6%) make up the majority of sales by region, with "Standard Class" (~59.8%) as a shipping mode accounting for the majority of shipments.

With regards to product category type, "Fishing" (~$5.4 million in total sales) is a clear leader with the next highest category type "Cleats" bringing in ~$3.4 million. Additionally, sales for the top 10 product category types are evenly distributed with regards to region and shipping mode



2. **Delivery**

3. **Customer**
